This project is a responsive personal portfolio website designed to professionally showcase my academic journey, technical skills, and web development projects. Built using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, the site features a clean, single-page layout with interactive elements like smooth scrolling and a modal gallery for certifications. It serves as a central hub to highlight my work as a Computer Science student, offering visitors an engaging way to explore my background and connect via integrated social links. The codebase is structured for simplicity and ease of customization, making it an ideal template for other students or developers looking to establish an online presence.
